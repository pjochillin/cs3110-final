We found some seriously impressive deals for you to check out on Thursday, including the first-ever discount on Apple's new M2 iPad Air that was just released yesterday.

I just started testing this model earlier this week, but I'm already so impressed that I need to tell BGR readers about it. Allow me to skip to the conclusion: It's awesome. The eufy X10 Pro Omni is the latest in a new breed of all-in-one robots. It's a robot vacuum and a robot mop, which obviously isn't anything we haven't seen before. What makes combo models like this extra cool is a special base station. When the X10 Pro Omni is done cleaning, the base station sucks out all the dirt and dust. On top of that, it washes the mopping pads with clean water and dries them with 113°F hot air. This ensures that the mop pads are clean, dry, and odor-free. Also, the debris bag in the base station can hold up to 2 months of dirt and dust before it needs to be changed. eufy X10 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum + 2 Replacement Washable Filter Price: $689.98 You Save: $120.00 (15%) Buy Now I'll talk more about the eufy X10 Pro Omni's performance in future coverage, but suffice it to say I'm impressed. It features 8,000 Pa suction, 1kg of mopping pressure, AI-powered navigation, and so much more. Now, for the best thing about the eufy X10 Pro Omni: the price. Comparable models sell for up to $1,500, but the X10 Pro Omni retails for just $800. That's crazy for such a powerful all-in-one robot. Better yet, there's an $810 bundle with two extra filters that's on sale for just $689.98. That's how much you would expect to pay for a mid-range model with auto-empty and auto-washing, but this is a premium model with high-end performance.

The high-frequency motion API released in watchOS 10, which takes advantage of the latest accelerometer and gyroscope in Apple Watch to detect rapid changes in velocity and acceleration, has equipped developers such as Golfshot with tools to create innovative new experiences that help users improve their golf swing and performance. For swing practice, Golfshot’s new Swing ID On-Range experience, launching today, utilizes this API to detect the precise moment the club strikes the ball. Apple Watch sensors also offer a comprehensive analysis of a golfer’s swing from the beginning to the end of the motion, and users of any skill level can track key swing metrics with precision, including tempo, rhythm, backswing, transition, and wrist path, to improve their gameplay. On the course, Golfshot also offers GPS distances, scoring, Auto Shot Tracking, swing analysis, and Auto Strokes Gained — all on Apple Watch — so golfers can track every shot and see real-time distances to the green, hazards, and targets on more than 46,000 courses worldwide. Apple Watch also provides an automated data collection process on the course to let users experience postround flyover reviews and advanced stats analysis on iPhone to elevate their game. “Leveraging the full capabilities of Apple Watch has always been a priority for Golfshot since our first Apple Watch release in 2015,” said Alex Flores, Golfshot’s chief growth officer, in a statement. “Innovative features including Auto Shot Tracking and Swing ID — both powered by Apple Watch and sophisticated machine learning — truly help golfers improve their game by giving real-time, personalized data on the device that’s already with them.” The API released in watchOS 10 helps detect rapid changes in velocity and acceleration to help users improve their golf swing and performance. he new Swing ID On-Range experience in Golfshot, launching today, utilizes high-frequency motion data available with watchOS 10 to detect the precise moment the club strikes the ball. Swing ID On-Range offers a comprehensive view of a golfer’s swing from the beginning to the end of the motion. With Golfshot, golfers can score their round to get vital statistics for their game and learn where they have opportunity for improvement. Using machine learning, Golfshot offers Auto Shot Tracking on Apple Watch to automatically track every shot. Golfshot is one of many golf-focused third-party apps available for Apple Watch. Additional golf apps for Apple Watch offer unique functionality that allow golfers to: • Track shots, get precise yardages adjusted in real time and club recommendations, and even mark the pin directly from Apple Watch with Arccos, the official game tracker of the PGA TOUR. • See hole layouts, carry distances, approach views with color heat maps of the green, and slope arrows for reading putts, all from the wrist, with GolfLogix. • Track scores, stats, and shot distances, and access a free golf GPS on iPhone and Apple Watch with TheGrint. • Get essentials with a glance at Apple Watch, including distances, maps, scoring, and a shot tracker, with Hole19. • Plan shots, get distances, and track scores and stats all directly from Apple Watch with 18Birdies Golf GPS Tracker. Arccos has an AI range finder that displays distance to the front, middle, and back of the green with GPS yardages in white and real-time adjusted yardages in green, and offers personalized club recommendations. The Approach View in GolfLogix offers a comprehensive display of the green, including front, center, and back GPS distances and precise distance to the pin. Enhanced with detailed heat maps and contours, the screen also delivers centimeter-accurate visuals. TheGrint provides GPS distances, shot tracking, score tracking, and green maps — all from Apple Watch. With Hole19, golfers can plan every shot with maps on Apple Watch for a phone-free experience. In the 18Birdies Apple Watch app, users can plan their shots with accurate, real-time distances to the front, middle, and back of the green. Apple Watch Features for Golfers Apple Watch Ultra 2 features a bold titanium case and flat sapphire front crystal with Apple’s brightest display ever, making it even more readable in harsh sunlight when out on the course. Additionally, the rugged and capable device offers 36-hour battery life with regular use, or up to 12 hours running an outdoor workout with GPS, and the best GPS of any Apple Watch. Golfers can track activity throughout the day on Apple Watch with the Workout app and see active calories from their round. Apple Watch can also help golfers stay connected by allowing them to receive important messages right from their wrist, while the double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 makes viewing and sending messages even easier when the other hand is occupied.

      "description": "It's often better to use FaceTime over Wi-Fi for several reasons. The quality is better, and you won't eat through your mobile plan allowance. But if you're on the go or continue experiencing connectivity problems, you may have no choice but to use your cellular data instead. Today, I'll show you how to FaceTime without Wi-Fi on your iPhone and Mac. Let's get started. How to Use FaceTime Without Wi-Fi Using FaceTime on cellular data differs depending on whether you use an iPhone or a Mac, and I've included the instructions you must follow for both in the sections below. 1. Turn on Your Cellular Data (If it Isn't Already) If you're planning to use FaceTime on an iPhone or cellular iPad, you'll first need to turn on your cellular data. Doing so is easy. Just follow the steps below. Time needed: 1 minute. Open the Settings app and select Cellular. At the top of the next window is a toggle called Cellular Data. Switch this on so that it's green. Tap Cellular Data Options. Toggle Data Roaming on if you're outside your country of residence, and adjust Voice & Data and Data Mode to fit your preferences. 2. Allow FaceTime to Use Cellular Data After turning on your cellular data and adjusting your other settings, you'll need to let FaceTime use your mobile network. Follow these instructions to verify that you have (or to switch the feature on). Go to Settings \u003E Cellular. Scroll down to the Cellular Data section. Here, you'll see all of your apps and whether they have access to mobile data. When you see FaceTime, switch the toggle on so that it's now green. As you can see from the image below, I can now use FaceTime wherever I want. If you want to use FaceTime on a cellular plan because it's not working, read this guide on why FaceTime keeps failing (and how to fix it). 3. On a Mac: Tether Your iPhone While Macs don't support cellular data, you can use FaceTime on your device by tethering your iPhone. I recommend doing this if you're having persistent problems with your Wi-Fi that you can't control, and you're waiting for your provider to fix the problem. Follow these steps to connect to your smartphone. First, go to your iPhone. Navigate to Settings \u003E Cellular \u003E Personal Hotspot. Switch the Allow Others to Join toggle on and create a Wi-Fi password. Go to your Mac and switch Bluetooth on via the Control Center or System Settings. Tap the Wi-Fi symbol and select your iPhone. Enter the password when prompted, wait for your device to connect, and go to FaceTime. Use the app like normal. Although I still recommend using FaceTime with Wi-Fi, knowing how to use FaceTime during connectivity issues is always a good idea. Similarly, it's nice to understand your options when on the go. Now, you can keep up with your loved ones or those essential work conversations wherever you are. It’s often better to use FaceTime over Wi-Fi for several reasons.

If you buy something via one of our links, we may earn a commission.Apple recently revealed their latest line-up of iPads during its ‘Let Loose’ keynote, which for deal hunters means just one thing: deeply-discounted, last-generation iPads. Right now, the 5th generation Apple iPad Air with M1 chip is down to $399 from its original price of $599.Despite being released in 2022, the iPad Air is no slouch and, in fact, packs a lot of the same features as its successor. You’ll still get Touch ID, USB-C, and up to 10 hours of battery life. Both the new and old iPad Air models feature a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 12-megapixel front camera. Apple iPad Air (5th Generation), $399 (was $599) at Amazon Courtesy of Amazon Of course, you’ll be missing out on a few things by going with the previous generation, like a slightly larger screen, the revised front-facing camera placement (now in the side bezel as opposed to the top of the tablet), more storage, and the more powerful M2 chip. The 5th generation iPad Air packs the M1 chip which is plenty to run most MacOS applications without skipping a beat. While 4K video editing may be a bit of a stretch, this iPad can handle general browsing, photo editing and playing games on its 10.9-inch display just fine. This iPad Air is compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil ($79, down from $129 at Amazon) and Apple Pencil (USB-C) ($69, down from $79) for those who want to draw and take notes with a stylus. According to one user, \"I use this iPad mainly for digital art, note taking, and writing books. It’s great for graphic designers, digital artists, and/or students who need to take notes, study, do projects, or write papers (get a keyboard case for typing) and so much more.\"For an additional $78, you can pick AppleCare+ which extends your accidental damage coverage and technical support by two years.If you don’t need to have the latest-and-greatest iPad Air, this is an excellent time to invest in a very capable device. Right now, all five colors are available for $200 off. In fact, this current price is the lowest it's ever been (even lower than what was offered during Black Friday) but supplies are limited.",

Three months after its American launch, Bloomberg reported that Apple's VR headset could be shipping in several territories worldwide as early as next month, off the back of the firm's Worldwide Developers Conference.It's unclear how many headsets Apple has shifted since retail availability in the US but the high $3,500 price point has made the Vision Pro somewhat of a niche within a niche product. Global availability could heighten the demand though.And that's good news for the developers who are supporting the Vision Pro, including Owlchemy Labs. The studio announced back in February that it was porting VR hits Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator to Apple's headset, and CEO Andrew Eiche says that the strategy has always been for the studio's games to be on as many platforms as possible, regardless of how big the platforms are.

      "description": "The first M4 iPad Pro bend tests are in, and the initial consensus appears to be that Apple has managed to make its thinnest device ever just as durable as the previous generation M2 iPad Pro that it replaces. Two approaches were taken in bend tests by prominent tech YouTubers. JerryRigEverything for example forcibly applied pressure by bending the new device with his hands, while MobileReviewsEh took a different tack by placing the iPad under a force meter and applying gym weights on top to exert pressure within a limited contact area. When bending the iPad Pro from the back in the horizontal position, JerryRigEverything found that the device held up \"surprisingly well,\" as if \"suspicious levels of black magic structural integrity\" were going on. When forcibly bent from the back, the glass screen eventually rippled away from the frame, yet the display and operating system continued to function normally. When it came to putting pressure on the device vertically, however, it was a different story, and the iPad Pro quickly suffered a catastrophic split up the middle, originating from the USB-C port. JerryRigEverything then removed the display to reveal and remove the internals, including the new metal cowling that runs down the middle of the device. \"If Apple could add another more perpendicular spine running width-wise near the charging port, this thing probably would have survived,\" he added. JerryRigEverything concluded that the central spine of the new iPad Pro is \"definitely providing enough structure for horizontal bends,\" and should stand up to everyday use in a backpack or luggage. In his own AppleTrack test, Sam Kohl agreed: \"Is [its thinness] a durability risk? The answer is no. The spine that Apple put along the logic board is very good unless you are bending the corners in.\" After placing in excess of 70 pounds of weight on the center of the iPad Pro display until complete structural failure, MobileReviewsEh concluded that the new iPad Pro is \"just as tough if not a little bit tougher\" than the one it replaces, despite being 18-20% thinner than the M2 iPad Pro. All in all, another \"bendgate\" looks unlikely. For those unfamiliar with the controversy, Apple in 2019 admitted to shipping its then-new models with a \"very slight bend in the aluminum chassis,\" which it blamed on a \"side effect of the manufacturing process.\" Despite videos indicating that the 2018 iPad Pro models bent more easily than other models, Apple said the bend did not worsen over time or negatively affect the iPad's performance, and that concerns over the device's durability were unfounded. Nevertheless, some iPad owners were understandably upset to find defects in devices that cost hundreds of dollars.

That's obviously not true, but the iPad can't support every workflow — not yet. And, the iPad is better at some things than the Mac. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

After a lifetime without allowing them, Apple changed its rules once it started complaining about Europe’s … The post RetroArch turns your Apple TV into a Nintendo 64 emulator appeared first on BGR. Retro game emulators are finally available for iPhone users. After a lifetime without allowing them, Apple changed its rules once it started complaining about Europe's Digital Markets Act. While the adoption of retro game emulators on the App Store is still slow, with a few developers publishing and then pulling out their apps, we're finally seeing more interesting options. While Delta is the go-to app for everything retro game emulator, it still doesn't support Apple TV. Thankfully, developer Daniel de Matteis published RetroArch, a game emulator that works with the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. According to the developer, RetroArch is a free, ad-free, open source, and cross-platform frontend/framework for emulators, game engines, video games, media players, and other applications. With it, you can emulate an Atari, a Game Boy, a Super Nintendo, a PlayStation 1, and even a Nintendo 64. This app's features include: Netplay Soft patching RetroAchievements Save states MFi controller support Key remapping per core or per game Gyro Cheats Custom overlays Shaders Fast forward and rewind Game artwork AI translations Advanced latency management OK, but how do I play ROMs with this retro game emulator? https://twitter.com/sigjudge/status/1790873751552237902?s=46 It's not straight-up how to play ROms with RetroArch. If you don't get intimidated by the 90s style, it's actually pretty easy. Once you open this Apple TV retro emulator app for the first time, it will give you two directories to import files: I preferred using the ",

Apple announced it’s introducing a host of accessibility features to Vision Pro, which is set to include Live Captions for the deaf or hard of hearing. It certainly feels like an important first step in eventually kitting the device with real-time translation at some point down the road. The visionOS update, which is said to arrive some point later this year, will also add adjustable captions for Apple Immersive Video, and support for ‘Made for iPhone’ hearing devices and cochlear hearing processors. Additionally, accessibility features will include options to Reduce Transparency, Smart Invert, and Dim Flashing Lights for users with low vision or those sensitive to bright lights and flashing. Since the update is system-wide, things like Live Captions will allow users to follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations, but also audio from all apps, such as FaceTime or streaming content that isn’t already subtitled. Meanwhile, the most recent demo of ChatGPT-4o (seen below) could be a sign of things to come, as it showcases just how good real-time translation has gotten—probably better than you’d expect. Provided Apple decides to push such a feature in the near-future, it could mean face-to-face conversations will soon have subtitles, like you might see on TV or in video games. It could also allow for content that isn’t already subtitled to benefit as well, letting you catch up on the latest episode of that Turkish soap opera, Italian Serie B football match, or even figure out what Scottish people are actually saying. That’s not to say it would be perfect, but it could be hypothetically implemented right now with some degree of success. Granted, Apple wouldn’t be the first to highlight such a feature when the company does come around to the idea. Before Google shuttered its Project Iris AR glasses, Google was teasing real-time translation as an important add-on that does essentially what I described above. This follows an ongoing push by Apple to make Vision Pro probably one of the most accessible headsets on the market. It already includes voice input in addition to both hand and eye-tracking for easily traversing UI, as well as features such as VoiceOver, Zoom, and Color Filters for those with low vision. Other accessibility features include Switch Control, Sound Actions, and Dwell Control, which Apple says helps those with physical disabilities.
