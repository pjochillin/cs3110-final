  Our project is a finance analyzer. It parses and analyzes historical financial
  data from various sources, such as stock prices, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies.
  The analyzer can also provide insights to volatility measures, moving averages,
  as well as create predictive models.

  The I/O is a GUI that manages all of the different options that the tool has.

  In the demo, we have so far implemented analyzing stock prices and providing insights
  to stock trends by outputting images of graphs showing the recent trends in a specific
  ticker.
